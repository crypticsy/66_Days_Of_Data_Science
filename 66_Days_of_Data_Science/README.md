    <p align="justify"> While taking the course <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-statistics" target="_blank">Introduction to Statistics</a> as part of the track <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-analyst-in-sql" target="_blank">Data Analyst in SQL,</a> I had the chance to review probability, distributions, the central limit theorem, correlation, and hypothesis testing. While revising the dependence and conditional probabilities, I was also able to recall the normal and poisson distributions (k = * n). </p>
    <p align="justify"> I also took <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-sql" target="_blank">Introduction to SQL</a> as part of the same curriculum, which helped me revise the basic sql queries to read and view data from tables. Because of this revision, I learned about "VIEW," a concept I was¬†never aware of before. To summarize, views are virtual tables whose contents are determined by queries. It only allows you to restrict access to the database and does not significantly increase the performance of SQL queries. Nonetheless, it was a useful trick to have in my SQL toolbox for increasing readability. </p>

Unlike the previous time, I did not get to learn a new concept, but it was a good recollection of all these principles, particularly concerning conventions for writing SQL to promote readability, as I had become a little sloopy regarding this. </p>

    <p align="justify"> I took the course <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/joining-data-in-sql" target="_blank">Joining Data in SQL</a>, the fifth Course under the track <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-analyst-in-sql" target="_blank">Data Analyst in SQL</a>. It included an introduction to various types of joins (inner, outer, cross & self) as well as set theory (union, intersect & except) joins. The cross joins and set theory section was incredibly beneficial as my perspective on desiging tables using minimal readable query was expanded due to these concepts. While I recall reading about it in my undergrad curriculum, putting it into practice has helped me comprehend it much better. In addition, subqueries in the "WHERE", "FROM" and "SELECT" keywords were covered in the course. I had never used subqueries in the "SELECT" & "FROM" section before, hence I learned some cool tricks up my sleeves. I have added some syntaxes that I learned as follows: </p>

    <h4> Summary : </h4>
    <p align="justify"> Machine learning, the most trending topic in today's generation is nothing more than a series of if and else statements. With SQL, a similar scenario occurs when you use the CASE statement to insert new values into a table based on existing records. To be more specific, the first module in <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-manipulation-in-sql" target="_blank">Data Manipulation in SQL</a> that I took,' 'We'll Take the CASE' module focused on using case statements to generate labels, probability, and percentage based on supplied criteria. While accounting for only one-quarter of the course, this subject proved useful in a variety of ways. The following are some examples of the statement: </p>

        <summary> &nbsp; CASE Statement</summary>
        <pre><code><small>--- Example 1 : Basic
SELECT title,
    length,
    CASE
        WHEN length> 0 AND length <= 50
            THEN 'Short'
        WHEN length > 50 AND length <= 120
            THEN 'Medium'
        WHEN length> 120
            THEN 'Long'
        ELSE
            'Outlier'
    END AS duration

SELECT
c.name AS country,
-- Count games from the 2012/2013 season
count(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013'
THEN m.id ELSE NULL end) AS matches_2012_2013

    <h4> Summary : </h4>
    <p align="justify"> Continuing the remaining modules <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-manipulation-in-sql" target="_blank">Data Manipulation in SQL</a> course, I was able to gain insights on Simple Subqueires Joins, Correlated Subqueries (takes higher processing time), Multiple/Nested Subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTE). These concepts were handful in allowing to perform complex actions within SQL and gain data points that I once thought were only possible through pandas (a python library). </p>
    <p align="justify"> However, more significantly, I learned about window functions and the various types, such as Over, Rank, Partition, and Slide, throughout this course. While I had seen it before, I had never utilized it in practice, and I am pleased that this course allowed me to do so. Aggregating on columns that aren't in the grouping columns is likely the most useful skill¬†to have, especially when doing comparative analysis. </p>

    <h4> Summary : </h4>
    <p align="justify"> With the continuation of window functions, I have gotten slightly familiar with the notion of window function types, particularly fetching, framing, and ranking functions, which I had practiced today. While these functions seemed intimidating at first, they turned out to be considerably easy than I had anticipated. </p>
    <p align="justify"> Beside this, I attempted to put my knowledge into practice by answering practice questions in the "Advanced sql" section¬†of kaggle. It was a valuable experience since I was able to accurately utilize window functions and also learn about the 'UNNEST' function to load nested and repeated data from the tables. </p>

    <h4> Summary : </h4>
    <p align="justify"> Taking a break from the regular SQL courses, I delved into the everyday life of a data scientist, complete with current data science issues and how data scientists manage themselves and the organizations for which they operate. I was also able to take the following course on the non-technical abilities of a successful data scientist, which addressed not just the attributes that a person should have but also the role diplomacy plays while working in a professional setting. In addition, to polish my pandas abilities, I completed a Kaggle Learn course that served as a refresher on the techniques I use on a daily basis. </p>

    <h4> Summary : </h4>
    <p align="justify"> Leveraging the same elements in different ways has always lit up the neurons in my brain, allowing me to perceive the world in new ways. This occurred when learning how to use the aggregrate functions within the window functions to obtain new results. In fact, utilizing the same `SUM` and `AVG` functions to deliver moving totals and averages within sql itself with the assistance of frames and aggregrate functions made me leap on top of my bed.¬† There were so many things that sql could do that I had always assumed only pandas could accomplish. While creating sophisticated queries in pandas is faster, the execution time would be much faster if same queries were implemented directly in SQL without loading the dataset into memory. </p>
    <p align="justify"> Continuing this discovery, pivoting tables in SQL was also conceivable with `CROSSTAB`, as well as other beneficial functions like `ROLLUP`, `CUBE`, `COALESCE`, and `STRING AGG`, which would come in handy when relying only on SQL. </p>

    <h4> Summary : </h4>
    <p align="justify"> The focus of today's course was on data manipulation in PostgreSQL utilizing both built-in and user-defined functions. The built-in functions of PostgreSQL included common data types and their casts, date/time functions and operators, and string parsing and manipulation functions. While the most of the operators were familiar, I learned about several new ones, such as `INTERVAL` and `INITCAP`. Nevertheless, the postgreSQL extensions and full-text search capabilities were entirely new subjects, particularly `tsvector` (text search vector) to execute a full text search beyond the scope of the 'LIKE' operator. Knowing that PostgreSQL offers built-in extensions such as fuzzy string matching through 'levenshtein' and'similarity' blew my mind as I had previously only used it in Python. Learning the syntax to develop my own functions was also quite instructive. Overall, it was a productive weekend spent learning more about PostgreSQL. </p>

    <p align="justify"> Breaking the usual heavy dosage of study sessions, this particular course covered about the usage of relationship diagrams, constraints (primary key, foreign key, unique and not null), and data types for the columns. The most significant functions from this course are 'corr' and 'percentile desc,' which allow you to get correlation and discrete value from a percentile. Moreover, temporary tables were a notion I had heard of but had never used in practice, and this course was a huge help in reinforcing the concept of breaking large queries into smaller chunks. </p>

    <p align="justify"> With all the skills that I had accumilated so far, it was only about implementing them. While a proper implementation is yet to come, I could still practice within a real evironment through the course "Data-Driven Decision Making in SQL" and the project "When Was the Golden Age of Video Games?". These allowed me to use all of the concepts from data cleaning, manipulation to aggregration and concentrated on using groupings, joins and pivots to create complex tables. Today marks the end of the career track, and I'm over the moon with all the knowledge I've gained in these 12 days. Yay for learning! </p>

    <h4> Summary : </h4>
    <p align="justify"> As visualizing data through narrative storytelling is one of the most crucial skills for a data analyst to have, which sets them apart from their colleagues. I took a data visualization course that included story structure and its components (begining, middle, end, plot, protagonist, problem and transformation). It also demonstrated the use of flow diagrams to successfully represent linear data flow for effective story telling. Most notably, the course taught the principles of learning to demonstrate your analytic abilities utilizing the 4x4 progressive depth model:

    <p align="justify"> I took a break from learning today to prepare for the journey ahead! I made my own IBM account and configured Watson Studio to publish notebooks directly to my GitHub repository. I also explored in the world of SpaceX's rest API in order to extract useful data for future projects. We can get so enthused in learning new things that we forget to take a deep breath and get organized. However, not today. </p>

    <h4> Summary : </h4>
    <p align="justify"> Building on yesterday's exploration, today was all about extracting launch data from SpaceX using requests and beautiful soup. The objective was to determine the fruitfulness of starting a new business for a hypothetical company, SpaceY. During the course, I delved into the concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering, utilizing both python and SQL to analyze the data. Wrapping up with data science, I visually represented our findings using scatterplots and barplots to identify factors such as landing site, booster, and payload mass that can contribute to a higher success rate. </p>
    <p align="justify"> Aside from that, I took an AI ethics course and was introduced to Human-Centered-Design for AI and its significance. It not only helped me assess whether a project is worth transitioning to be done under¬†AI, but it also helped me grasp that AI systems are more effective when they work alongside people rather than independently. Also, I learned about the numerous types of biases and fairness that can emerge in an ML model when biased data/model is used, as garbage in, garbage out. </p>

        <summary> &nbsp; Six Types of Bias</summary>
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Historical Bias <ul>
                    <li>Occurs when the state of the world in which the data was generated is flawed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Representation bias <ul>
                    <li>Occurs when building datasets for training a model, if those datasets poorly represent the people that the model will serve.</li>
                    <li>Example : if the dataset used to train the models exclude darker skin tones.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Measurement bias <ul>
                    <li>Occurs when the accuracy of the data varies across groups.</li>
                    <li>This can happen when working with proxy variables (variables that take the place of a variable that cannot be directly measured), if the quality of the proxy varies in different groups.</li>
                    <li>Example : if the measurement apparatus shows reduced performance with dark skin tones.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Aggregation bias <ul>
                    <li>Occurs when groups are inappropriately combined, resulting in a model that does not perform well for any group or only performs well for the majority group.</li>
                    <li>This is often not an issue, but most commonly arises in medical applications.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Evaluation bias <ul>
                    <li>Occurs when evaluating a model.</li>
                    <li>If the benchmark data (used to compare the model to other models that perform similar tasks) does not represent the population that the model will serve.</li>
                    <li>Example : if the dataset used to benchmark the model excludes darker skin tones.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Deployment bias <ul>
                    <li>Occurs when the problem the model is intended to solve is different from the way it is actually used.</li>
                    <li>If the end users don‚Äôt use the model in the way it is intended, there is no guarantee that the model will perform well.</li>

        <summary> &nbsp; Four fairness criteria</summary>
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Demographic parity / statistical parity <ul>
                    <li>It says the model is fair if the composition of people who are selected by the model matches the group membership percentages of the applicants.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Equal opportunity fairness <ul>
                    <li>It ensures that the proportion of people who should be selected by the model (&quot;positives&quot;) that are correctly selected by the model is the same for each group.</li>
                    <li>We refer to this proportion as the true positive rate (TPR) or sensitivity of the model.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Equal accuracy <ul>
                    <li>It is the percentage of correct classifications (people who should be denied and are denied, and people who should be approved who are approved) should be the same for each group.</li>
                    <li>If the model is 98% accurate for individuals in one group, it should be 98% accurate for other groups.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Group unaware / Fairness through unawareness <ul>
                    <li>Group unaware fairness removes all group membership information from the dataset.</li>
                    <li>For instance, we can remove gender data to try to make the model fair to different gender groups.</li>
                    <li>Similarly, we can remove information about race or age.</li>

    <h4> Summary : </h4>
    <p align="justify"> After completing exploratory data analysis, I delved into creating an interactive dashboard with plolty dash and folium to facilitate in real-time data analysis. It was a good refresher on the concept of dash callbacks to help translate user inputs and update existing charts based on those inputs. In addition, as part of the course, I touched on predictive analysis to determine the optimum model and hyperparameters needed to develop a model capable of predicting the launch's success rate. To do this, I used Preprocessing, GridSearchCV, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, and KNeighborsClassifier to help automate model selection, as well as a confusion matrix to evaluate true accuracy much more clearly. </p>
    <p align="justify"> With plenty of time left in the day, I investigated the creation of an effective data analysis report and its components. While data reports vary depending on the use and data included, I was able to get a general idea of how a data report should look through the course. </p>

    <p align="justify"> Six individuals, each with their unique experiences in data, shared their stories through the course. These narratives covered their journeys starting out in data analytics, the inspiration behind their work, the impact of their contributions on the organization, their current endeavors, and practical advice based on their experiences. One of the prominent discussions was about the ethical considerations that data scientists face while conducting an analysis, where certain data points may conflict with their personal values. However, what had a significant impact on my outlook towards the data science field was gaining insights about the industry and the people involved in it during the course. </p>
    <p align="justify"> In addition to my current pursuits, I have become interested in side hustle strategies for data science. The monotony of only having one job motivated me to seek out new opportunities to expand my abilities and skills. I discovered a range of options such as writing, training, consulting, attending conferences, and engaging with academics. These activities may include co-authoring a book, writing a chapter in a second edition, providing training in R or Python during free time, through in-site or online classes. These endeavors not only benefit the individual but can also contribute to growing the data science industry. As one gains expertise, opportunities such as giving speeches at conferences and consulting with organizations can lead to expanding networks and discovering new possibilities. It's important to note that if one is currently involved in academics as a student or teacher, there are resources beyond the classroom that can be taken advantage of, such as university libraries and websites like GitHub Education. By making the most of what is available and staying informed about the latest tools and patterns in data analytics, one can continue to expand their knowledge and skills in this new and exciting field. </p>

    <h4> Summary : </h4>
    <p align="justify"> Today marks the first day of my journey into the world of Tableau, following a 7-day break from my usual learning streak. I began my day by loading workbooks and familiarizing myself with the navigation of Tableau through the menu pane and tool bar. Next, I dove into the world of sorting and various types of filters (extract filter, data source filter, context filter, dimension filter, and measure filter) in Tableau. I then proceeded to using aggregration and creating custom columns using calculated fields that leverage the inbuilt functions within Tableau. Moving on, I explored the topic of creating visualizations on geo maps using geocoding. I was thrilled to see how easy it was to map data and extract meaningful insights based on the location of the data points. I also learned how to work with dates and create reference lines, trend lines, and forecasting using Tableau. Finally, I learned how to convey my findings with dashboards and stories in Tableau. </p>
    <p align="justify"> Overall, it was an interesting and exciting day of learning to fully comprehend the tool that has/can significantly decrease my burden by providing rapid visualizations that would take hours to complete in Python. I'm looking forward to applying these skills to real-world scenarios and deepening my knowledge in the days to come. </p>

    <h4> Summary : </h4>
    <p align="justify">Today's focus was on preparing for analysis using Tableau. I began by familiarizing myself with various slicing and dicing functions and visualizations that are readily available in the software. It was exciting to get the opportunity to make complex visualizations and help analyze a hypothetical scenario. The scenario contained a "Two by two discount" promotional campaign, which seeks to increase customer purchases on the two overall lowest riding days, as well as the two lowest windows of time, excluding nighttime. Some of my favorite visualizations included a heat map to show sales volume by product and a scatter plot to show the correlation between time of day and sales. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that allowed me to build on my existing Tableau skills and gain new insights into data analysis.</p>

    <br/><img src="./images/weekday_trends_by_gender_and_time_segment.png" alt="weekday_trends_by_gender_and_time_segment">
    <p align="justify">Furthermore, I explored more of Tableau's capabilities with user data. I added filters and created KPI for dashboards, which helped to better understand user behavior and trends. Additionally, I created a histogram using bins and compared it with a traditional line chart to understand the distribution of a specific variable. I found that the histogram provided a more granular view of the data and revealed insights that were not visible through the line chart. </p>

    Similarly, tableau provides various features that can be used to group, filter, and parameterize data in order to gain insights and create more meaningful visualizations that I was able to utilize. To explain further, groups can be used to combine similar data points into a single category. Sets are similar to groups, but instead of combining data points into a category, they allow you to create subsets of data based on specific criteria. Parameters allow you to create user-defined inputs that can be used to adjust various aspects of a visualization.

    Today's learning focused on understanding the data analysis flow in Tableau, which involves data check, data exploration, analyzing and visualizing data, dashboarding, and communicating insights. To effectively learn these concepts, I decided to download Tableau Public and perform the analysis. This decision proved to be helpful, as it eliminated any lag present while using the virtual machine provided by Datacamp, allowing me to work faster and more efficiently. However, using the public version meant that I was restricted and couldn't save my progress. During the analysis process, I utilized a range of visualizations, such as dual-axis graphs, scatter plots, and maps, to better understand the data. Additionally, I made use of calculated fields, bins, and bin sizes, which helped me analyze the data more effectively. To take advantage of Tableau's interactivity feature, I leveraged the power of filters, visualizations as filters, and parameters. By understanding the data analysis flow in Tableau and utilizing its features, I was able to effectively find customer churn for a hypothetical company.

    Today, I continued with the remaining modules from the last course and came across a section that was all about describing data. This involved looking at various methods to access the center, variability, rescale, and associations within a dataset. When it comes to finding the center of the data, data analysts usually refer to the mode (most common score), mean (average), and median (middle score/50%). On the other hand, variability or how spread out the data is can be found using techniques such as range (difference from maximum to minimum), quartiles (split into 4 equal parts), IQR (Q3 - Q1), variance, and standard deviation (average distance from the mean). In order to rescale data for better interpretation, comparison, and probability analysis, the course introduced the use of z-score. The course concluded with a summary of basic and conditional probability, along with sampling variations.

   Today's course in Tableau was focused on performing calculations within the software to create new columns and rows using calculated fields. Throughout the lesson, I encountered various types of errors, which were detected by Tableau, as well as errors that resulted from the equations themselves. The course provided exercises to sharpen my skills in finding and tackling these errors. Following this, the course delved into data granularity and how it increases with the number of dimensions exposed in Rows and Columns or in the Marks, such as detail, color, shape, and so on. While "Group by" is used to tackle data granularity in pandas and SQL, in Tableau, LOD expressions are used to compute aggregations easily. There are three types of LOD Expressions: INCLUDE, EXCLUDE, and FIXED, each controlling the level of detail at which a calculation is performed and not depending on the dimensions used in the visualization.
