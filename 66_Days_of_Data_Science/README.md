    <summary> &nbsp; 📝 &nbsp; Day 1 - Revision of Statistics and Basic SQL </summary>

    🗓️ Date: 2023-02-15

<blockquote>
    While taking the course "Introduction to Statistics" as part of the track "Data Analyst in SQL," I had the chance to review probability, distributions, the central limit theorem, correlation, and hypothesis testing. While revising the dependence and conditional probabilities, I was also able to recall the normal and poisson distributions (k = * n).

<blockquote>
    I also took "Introduction to SQL" as part of the same curriculum, which helped me revise the basic sql queries to read and view data from tables. Because of this revision, I learned about "VIEW," a concept I was never aware of before. To summarize, views are virtual tables whose contents are determined by queries. It only allows you to restrict access to the database and does not significantly increase the performance of SQL queries. Nonetheless, it was a useful trick to have in my SQL toolbox for increasing readability.

    <summary> &nbsp; 📝 &nbsp; Day 2 - Revision of Intermediate SQL Queries </summary>

    🗓️ Date: 2023-02-16

<blockquote>
    Continuing on from Day 1, I chose the "Intermediate SQL" course from the same track, which included queries for selecting, filtering, aggregating, sorting, and grouping. Unlike the previous time, I did not get to learn a new concept, but it was a good recollection of all these principles, particularly concerning conventions for writing SQL to promote readability, as I had become a little sloopy regarding this.
