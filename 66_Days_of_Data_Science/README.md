<h4> Summary : </h4>
<p align="justify">
    While taking the course <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-statistics" target="_blank">Introduction to Statistics</a> as part of the track <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-analyst-in-sql" target="_blank">Data Analyst in SQL,</a> I had the chance to review probability, distributions, the central limit theorem, correlation, and hypothesis testing. While revising the dependence and conditional probabilities, I was also able to recall the normal and poisson distributions (k = * n). 
</p>
<p align="justify">
    I also took <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-sql" target="_blank">Introduction to SQL</a> as part of the same curriculum, which helped me revise the basic sql queries to read and view data from tables. Because of this revision, I learned about "VIEW," a concept I was¬†never aware of before. To summarize, views are virtual tables whose contents are determined by queries. It only allows you to restrict access to the database and does not significantly increase the performance of SQL queries. Nonetheless, it was a useful trick to have in my SQL toolbox for increasing readability.

<p align="justify">
    Continuing on from Day 1, I chose the <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-sql" target="_blank">Intermediate SQL</a> course from the same track, which included queries for selecting, filtering, aggregating, sorting, and grouping. Unlike the previous time, I did not get to learn a new concept, but it was a good recollection of all these principles, particularly concerning conventions for writing SQL to promote readability, as I had become a little sloopy regarding this.

<h4> Summary : </h4>
<p align="justify">
    I took the course <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/joining-data-in-sql" target="_blank">Joining Data in SQL</a>, the fifth Course under the track <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-analyst-in-sql" target="_blank">Data Analyst in SQL</a>. It included an introduction to various types of joins (inner, outer, cross & self) as well as set theory (union, intersect & except) joins. The cross joins and set theory section was incredibly beneficial as my perspective on desiging tables using minimal readable query was expanded due to these concepts.  While I recall reading about it in my undergrad curriculum, putting it into practice has helped me comprehend it much better. In addition, subqueries in the "WHERE", "FROM" and "SELECT" keywords were covered in the course. I had never used subqueries in the "SELECT" & "FROM" section before, hence I learned some cool tricks up my sleeves. I have added some syntaxes that I learned as follows:

<h4> Summary : </h4>
<p align="justify">
    Machine learning, the most trending topic in today's generation is nothing more than a series of if and else statements. With SQL, a similar scenario occurs when you use the CASE statement to insert new values into a table based on existing records. To be more specific, the first module in <a href="https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-manipulation-in-sql" target="_blank">Data Manipulation in SQL</a> that I took,' 'We'll Take the CASE' module focused on using case statements to generate labels, probability, and percentage based on supplied criteria. While accounting for only one-quarter of the course, this subject proved useful in a variety of ways. The following are some examples of the statement:

  <summary> &nbsp; CASE Statement</summary>
<pre><code><small><small>--- Example 1 : Basic

SELECT title,
    length,
    CASE
        WHEN length> 0 AND length <= 50
            THEN 'Short'
        WHEN length > 50 AND length <= 120
            THEN 'Medium'
        WHEN length> 120
            THEN 'Long'
        ELSE
            'Outlier'
    END AS duration
FROM film
ORDER BY title;


--- Example 2 : Count

SELECT
    c.name AS country,
    -- Count games from the 2012/2013 season
    count(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013'
            THEN m.id ELSE NULL end) AS matches_2012_2013
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;


--- Example 3 : Percentage

SELECT
    c.name AS country,
    -- Round the percentage of tied games to 2 decimal points
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
            WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
            END),2) AS pct_ties_2013_2014,
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
            WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
            END),2) AS pct_ties_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
    GROUP BY country;
