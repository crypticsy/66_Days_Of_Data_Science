# 392. Is Subsequence
# Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

# A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 
# (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
# Output: false

# Constraints:

# 0 <= s.length <= 100
# 0 <= t.length <= 104
# s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
