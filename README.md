Let's embark on an exciting journey of habit formation, shall we?

The study by [Lally](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.674/abstract) on habit formation revealed that it could take anywhere between 18 to 254 days for individuals to successfully integrate a new habit, depending on the individual and the complexity of the habit. However, on average, it takes approximately 66 days for a new habit to become ingrained in our daily lives.

Inspired by this remarkable research, I'm embarking on a thrilling quest to master new skills, day by day! Get ready to flex your neural networks, optimize those hyperparameters, and wrangle some data as we embark on this epic adventure to elevate our technical acumen!
